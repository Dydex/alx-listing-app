# ALX Listing App

## Project Overview

The **ALX Listing App** is a simplified **Airbnb clone** focused on building a property listing page.  
The goal of this project is to practice **Next.js 13+**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** by implementing reusable components, organized project structure, and responsive design.

## Project Structure

Here’s a quick breakdown of the main directories:

- **`components/`** → Contains all reusable UI components such as cards, buttons, and layout elements.
- **`interfaces/`** → Stores TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `CardProps`, `ButtonProps`) to enforce type safety across the project.
- **`constants/`** → Holds configuration values, API URLs, and UI text strings used throughout the project.
- **`public/assets/`** → Contains static assets like images, SVGs, and icons (e.g., placeholder property images, logos).
